# lockbox-box-service

A simple service providing secure box storage with guardian management. This service allows users to manage boxes and guardians using a simple API managed with AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Boxes contain documents and associated unlock requests, and can be updated by authorized parties.

## Overview

The lockbox-box-service provides endpoints for managing boxes and associated unlock requests. Boxes can be created and updated by the owner, and guardians can assist with unlocking a box via approval or rejection. The service performs proper validations ensuring only authorized users may perform updates.

## Project Architecture

The lockbox-box-service is built as a multi-service AWS Serverless application with the following components:

1. **Box Service**: Core service for managing boxes, documents, guardians, and unlock requests
2. **Invitation Service**: Service for handling the invitation process for adding guardians
3. **Shared Library**: Common code shared between services including models, authentication, and database access

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Rust with Axum web framework
- **Deployment**: AWS Lambda and API Gateway via SAM
- **Database**: Amazon DynamoDB
- **Authentication**: Amazon Cognito
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

### Data Model

- **Boxes**: Contains documents and guardian relationships
- **Invitations**: Temporary invitations to become a guardian for a box, with user-friendly codes

## Running the Service

This service is designed exclusively for AWS Lambda and cannot be run as a standalone HTTP server.

## Deployment

This service is automatically deployed to AWS Lambda via GitHub Actions when changes are merged into the main branch. The deployment process includes:

1. Running tests to ensure code quality
2. Building the Rust code targeting Amazon Linux 2
3. Packaging the binary for Lambda deployment
4. Updating the Lambda function code

### Prerequisites for Deployment

To enable automatic deployment, you need to configure the following GitHub secrets:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: AWS access key with permissions to update Lambda
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: AWS secret key
- `AWS_REGION`: AWS region where the Lambda function is deployed

### Manual Deployment

If you need to deploy manually, you can use AWS SAM:

```bash
# Install SAM CLI if you haven't already
brew install aws-sam-cli

# Build for Lambda
cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
mkdir -p target/lambda
cp target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/lockbox-box-service target/lambda/bootstrap
cd target/lambda && zip -j bootstrap.zip bootstrap

# Deploy using SAM
sam deploy --guided
```

## Testing

For testing the application, you can use:

```bash
cargo test
```

This will run all unit and integration tests defined in the codebase.

## CI/CD Pipeline

The service uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:

- **CI Pipeline**: Runs on all pull requests and pushes to main
  - Code formatting check
  - Linting with Clippy
  - Unit tests

- **Deployment Pipeline**: Runs only on pushes to main branch after tests pass
  - Builds the application for Lambda
  - Packages the binary
  - Deploys to AWS Lambda

## Data Storage

The service uses DynamoDB to store box records. Key features include:
- Tables are defined in the CloudFormation template
- Global Secondary Index (GSI) for querying by owner_id
- Guardian relationships are stored in the box record

See the `GUARDIAN_INDEX_IMPLEMENTATION.md` file for details on future improvements to guardian search functionality.

## Additional Notes

- All timestamps are in ISO8601 format.
- Ensure the `x-user-id` header is included in requests for proper authentication and authorization.
- Box records include both owner information and guardian relationships.

## Dependencies

- Rust
- Cargo
- AWS Lambda runtime
- DynamoDB
- AWS SAM for local testing and deployment
